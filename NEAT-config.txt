# NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks

# genome - member of population (ex. dragons), set of genes that together code for a (neural network) phenotype
# gene - information coding for a particular aspect of a neural network phenotype
# node gene - specifies a single neuron (ex. input, output)
# node connection - specifies a single connection between neurons
# genomic distance - approximate measure of the difference between genomes, used in dividing the population into species

# node output function: activation(bias+(responseâˆ—aggregation(inputs)))
